Problem Overview

Audio-Enhanced Conversational AI Chatbot

People often consume a wealth of information via videos, webinars, and podcasts but lack efficient ways to interact with or query specific information within these media. The challenge lies in converting long-form audio or video content into an interactive experience, allowing users to ask questions and retrieve precise information from the content without manually searching or listening through the entire file.

Problem Statement

Develop a tool that transforms video or audio content into an interactive, conversational experience by transcribing audio, processing content for context, and providing accurate, real-time answers to user questions.
